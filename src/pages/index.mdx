            A hackathon is a free, weekend-long tech event where students learn new skills, build interesting projects, and have fun! We will have free merch, free food, and industry professionals to connect with!

            &hacks has something for everyone! Whether you've been coding for years or have never written a line, we have workshops, mentors, and resources to help you learn and build something amazing.

            Once our final schedule goes live, we'll have a hacking kick-off time where you can start working! If you're bringing an existing project to &hacks, you'll just need to be transparent about what work was done during the event.
